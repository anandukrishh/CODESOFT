# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster
based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.
It uses Machine Learning classification techniques.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains passenger details including:
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked Port
- Survival Status (Target)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

## ✅ Result
The model predicts survival with good accuracy.
